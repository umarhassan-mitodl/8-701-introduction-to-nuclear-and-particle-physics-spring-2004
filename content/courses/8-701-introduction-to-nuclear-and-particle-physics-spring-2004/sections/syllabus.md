Description
-----------

This course covers the phenomenology and experimental foundations of particle and nuclear physics including the fundamental forces and particles and composites. Topics include:

*   Interactions of particles with matter, and detectors
*   SU(2), SU(3), models of mesons and baryons
*   QED, weak interactions, parity violation, lepton-nucleon scattering, and structure functions
*   QCD, gluon field and color
*   W and Z fields, electro-weak unification, the CKM matrix
*   Nucleon-nucleon interactions, properties of nuclei, single and collective particle models
*   Electron and hadron interactions with nuclei
*   Relativistic heavy ion collisions, and transition to quark-gluon plasma

Prerequisites
-------------
